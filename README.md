The project was created as part of the Social and Technological Networks class during
my AI MSc in the University of Edinburgh (2018/19). It was awarded a grade of 90/100 (A1).

As the amount of available data increases so dothe opportunities of approaching old problemsfrom a different viewpoint.   Our paper tests anovel approach in creating bus routes based onopen-data, using taxi trips in Manhattan.  Afterbuilding a bus transportation network we com-pare  its performance  to  taxis and  find  that onaverage it requires 18 more minutes to completea journey.
