# Creating bus routes using taxi data

The project was created as part of the Social and Technological Networks class during
my AI MSc in the University of Edinburgh (2018/19). It was awarded a grade of 90/100 (A1).

## Abstract

As the amount of available data increases so do the opportunities of approaching old problems from a different viewpoint.   Our paper tests a novel approach in creating bus routes based on open-data, using taxi trips in Manhattan.  After building a bus transportation network we compare  its performance  to  taxis and  find  that on average it requires 18 more minutes to complete a journey.
