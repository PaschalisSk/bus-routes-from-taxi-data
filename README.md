# Creating bus routes using taxi data

The project was created as part of the Social and Technological Networks class during
my AI MSc in the University of Edinburgh (2018/19).

The scripts were run in the following order:

1. TaxiDataParser.py
1. SampleTrips.py
1. ClusterEndpoints.py
1. RelocateBusStops.py
1. ClusterBusStops.py
1. CreateBusRoutes.py
1. GraphBusRoutes.py
1. RelocateTrips.py
1. CalculateBusTrips.py
1. ProcessResults.py
